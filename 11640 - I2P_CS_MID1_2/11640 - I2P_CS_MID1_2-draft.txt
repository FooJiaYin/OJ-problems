Problem:
`break` in the `if` statement only break one level of loop

Solution #1: loop condition
Set get==0 in loop condition: `for(i=0; i<n && get==0; i++)`
* it will still goes through `i++`
* `stick[i-1]` at the end 

Solution #2: Using break
Add `if(get) break;` at the end of every loop;
* Not going through `i++`
