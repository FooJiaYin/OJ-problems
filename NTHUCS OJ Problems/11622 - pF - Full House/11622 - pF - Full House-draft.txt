A=0
B=0

if (card2==card1)
A++

else B++

if (card==card1) A++
if (card==card2) B++

if (A==2&&B==3||A==3&&B==2)

Problem
- (Solved) Errors occur when card1==card2, cannot set new card as B
- (Solved) CANNOT scan "10" as %c!!! ==> use getchar()

(TA)
## Method 1: array card[5] (store the occurance of each card)
## Method 2: sort the cards
